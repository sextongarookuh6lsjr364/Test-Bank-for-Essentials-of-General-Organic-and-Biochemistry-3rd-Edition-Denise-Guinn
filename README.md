  * * Author: W. H. Freeman
   
  * Teaching all of the necessary concepts within the constraints of a one-term chemistry course can be challenging. Authors Denise Guinn and Rebecca Brewer have drawn on their 14 years of experience with the one-term course to write a textbook that incorporates biochemistry and organic chemistry throughout each chapter, emphasizes cases related to allied health, and provides students with the practical quantitative skills they will need in their professional lives.
